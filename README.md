# ServiceNow-Studio

Guided App Creator and Studio are ServiceNowâ€™s development environments for creating and modifying applications.

## Guided App Creator
Use Guided App Creator to get started with building applications. Guided App Creator walks application builders through the most common steps in creating custom applications.

## Studio
Use Studio to edit application files. Studio provides easy navigation to all files in an application, has a tabbed interface, and offers many other convenient features such as keyboard shortcuts, code search, and more:

Create and edit applications
Create application files
Determine which application files comprise an application
Link applications to a GitHub source code repository
Publish applications to the ServiceNow application repository
Submit applications to the ServiceNow App Store

## Application Scope
Applications created in Guided App Creator or Studio are known as scoped applications. Scope uniquely identifies an application and its components. Application components are referred to as application files. Using scope prevents naming conflicts between application files from different applications. Scope also restricts or grants access to application files by other applications.
