# ServiceNow-Studio

Guided App Creator and Studio are ServiceNowâ€™s development environments for creating and modifying applications.

## Guided App Creator
Use Guided App Creator to get started with building applications. Guided App Creator walks application builders through the most common steps in creating custom applications.

## Studio
Use Studio to edit application files. Studio provides easy navigation to all files in an application, has a tabbed interface, and offers many other convenient features such as keyboard shortcuts, code search, and more:

Create and edit applications
Create application files
Determine which application files comprise an application
Link applications to a GitHub source code repository
Publish applications to the ServiceNow application repository
Submit applications to the ServiceNow App Store

## Application Scope
Applications created in Guided App Creator or Studio are known as scoped applications. Scope uniquely identifies an application and its components. Application components are referred to as application files. Using scope prevents naming conflicts between application files from different applications. Scope also restricts or grants access to application files by other applications.

## To open:
Use the Application navivator to open:
- Systems Applications => My Company Applications Module
- Create new


##Configure the new application in the General Info pane.

Application Details
Naming an application is the first step in creating an application.
- Name: Application name
- Description: Description of the application
- Drag and drop or browse to upload logo: Image for the application
- Scoped/Global: Select the scope of the application
- Scope: Unique identifier for the application, limited to 18 characters (Value is automatically populated)
- Click the Create button.

## Roles
Roles add security to applications. To restrict access to an application, use the Roles choice list to select a role. Only users with the role can access the application. To create a role, click the Create new role link. To allow access to all users, do not add a role.

Click the Continue button.

## Application Formats
Formats are how users interact with an application. Select one or more formats for the application. The example uses the Classic format.
